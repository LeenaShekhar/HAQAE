# HAQAE
Hierarchical And Quantized AutoEncoders 

Code for the EMNLP 2018 paper "Hierarchical Quantized Representations for Script Generation"

A quick note: The model in the paper is called HAQAE, however, for whatever reason, during development the model was called DAVAE.
This is not a different model. DAVAE is HAQAE. We will change this in the future. 

This README will be updated much more within the coming couple of months with actually useful information (for reference, this statement was uttered on the 27th of August in the year
2018).
